# AI Newsroom Generator

This is a full-stack mock application that simulates generating news articles using AI.

## How It Works

- The **frontend** is built with HTML/JS and allows users to enter a news idea.
- The **backend** (Node.js + Express) simulates OpenAI responses with mock data for demo purposes.

## Run Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

##  Note
This version uses fake articles due to exhausted OpenAI credits. In production, replace mock logic with actual OpenAI API calls.
